# BusTracking
Real Time Bus Tracking Repository for xPro course

Description: This is an exercise in learning how to display animated map markers using the Mapbox API. When run, markers appear one at a time and show route 11 of the Saudi Public Transport Company (SAPTCO) between downtown and the industrial area of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The appearance of each marker is supposed to show the movement of the bus, and does not necessarily represent a stop along the route.

Usage: This program requires a valid Mapbox access token. Copy/download the files in the BusTracking folder and edit line 2 of mapanimation.js with your access token. Then open index.html in a web browser and click the button at the top left of the screen. You should see something like the following:

Roadmap: This exercise can be improved in the future by adding a feature where the map marker animation will stop at the location of each bus stop, show a pop-up description with the location, and then close and continue. More map markers can be added to better show movement since the bus travels a long distance over several roads.
